      let age2 = age;
      console.log(age, age2);

      console.log(age, age2); //age updates, not age2


      let name = 'Wes';
      let name2 = name;
      console.log(name, name2);
      name = 'Wesley';
      console.log(name, name2); //name updates, not name2

    // Let's say we have an array
      const players = ['Wes', 'Sarah', 'Ryan', 'Poppy'];

    // and we want to make a copy of it.
      const team = players;
      console.log(team, players);

    // You might think we can just do something like this:
      //team[3] = 'Lux'; 
        

    // however what happens when we update that array?
          // replaces both - updates to arrays reference back


    // now here is the problem!
    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!
    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!
    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!

    // one way 
      const team2 = players.slice();

      team2[3] = 'Lux';
      console.log(team2);

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
      const team3 = [].concat(players);

      console.log(team3);

    // or use the new ES6 Spread
      const team4 = [...players];

      team4[3] = 'heee hawww';
      console.log(team4);

      const team5 = Array.from(players);
      console.log(team5);

      team5[3] = 'cool';
      console.log(team5, players);

    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // The same thing goes for objects, let's say we have a person object

    // with Objects
    const person = {
      name: 'Wes Bos',
      age: 80
    };

    // and think we make a copy:
      const captain = person;
      //captain.number = 99;

      //console.log(person);

    // how do we take a copy instead?
      const cap2 = Object.assign({}, person, {number: 99, age: 12});

      console.log(cap2, person);

    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread

      const cap3 = {...person};

      console.log(cap3);

    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.

    console.log(wes, dev);

    dev.social.twitter = '@coolman';
    console.log(wes.social, dev.social); 
      //reassigned the original, need to search for function 'cloneDeep' if going more than 1 level deep
      //!!warning!! do you need to go that deep? rarely need to go more than 1 level deep


      //Poor man's deep clone -- look into performance!!
    const dev2 = JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes));
    console.log(dev2);

    dev2.social.twitter = '@cooliotwitter';
    console.log(wes.social, dev2.social);

    //why does this work?
    JSON.stringify(wes); //typed in console, not an object
    JSON.parse(JSON.stringify(wes)); //typed in console, back to object
